def intent_identification_prompt(state: State) -> str:
  prompt = f"""
    You are an expert at identifying user intent based on the full conversation history.

    You are not a chatbot. Do not reply to the user.  
    Your job is to select the correct node (agent) that should handle the current state of the conversation.

    Conversation channel: {state.conversation_channel}  
    Current active agent: {state.active_node}

    Nodes available:
    - auth_node: Handles authentication and authorization queries.
    - appointment_node: Handles appointment andgreeting-related queries.
    - end: Use this when the current agent has already responded and we are waiting for the user's input â€” no further agent action is needed until the user replies.

    Your task:
    1. Analyze the **entire conversation history**.
    2. Decide what the **next system step** should be.
    3. Respond with one of: "auth_node", "appointment_node", or "end".

    Respond **only** in this JSON format:
    {{
      "active_node": "appointment_node",  // or "auth_node", or "end"
      "thinking": "Explain briefly why this node is the right one at this point."
    }}

    **Important Rules:**
    - If the user has just sent a message that requires a response from an agent, return the responsible agent node.
    - If the agent has already responded, and the next step is to wait for user input, return `"end"`.
    - Do not add extra fields, syntax, or commentary.
